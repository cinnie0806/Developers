    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong>1Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, until shimmering. Add
            the mushrooms and cook,
            stirring, until soft and brown, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and cook stirring, until soft and golden,
            about 8
            minutes. Add the celery, carrots, peppers and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to brown
            and become
            fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, garlic and onion powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon
            pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong>Add the cabbage to the pot and stir until it begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Pour in the
            crushed tomatoes, chicken
            broth and 1 cup water. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook until the cabbage
            is tender, 30
            to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>
